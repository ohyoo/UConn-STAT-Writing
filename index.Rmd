# Preface {-}

This book aims to train students in statistics and data science on academic
writing with professional tools such as LaTeX, BibTeX, R, and Git. 

This book is currently under-development, and it is meant to be 
an extended version of the book "Statistical Writing" <https://github.com/statds/stat-writing> written by Dr. Elizabeth Schifano and Dr. Jun Yan.

The notes are prepared with the **bookdown** R package [@xie2016bookdown], 
which can be installed from CRAN or Github: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is
defined by the first-level heading `#`.


To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install
TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
