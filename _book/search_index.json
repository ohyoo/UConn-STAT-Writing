The topic should be meaningful, be interesting to you, and be something which you already know at least somewhat and/or can find out more. The topic should also be something that is within your capacity restricted by your skill sets and time. A good first step is to review the literature to see what has already been done on the topic or on closely related problems. In short, select a project that excites you, but is also realistic and doable. You can get ideas for research by + attending seminars, conferences, and workshops; more and more resources are available online (e.g., a recent workshop on Foundation Models and Their Biomedical Applications: Bridging the Gap ); + reading reputable and relevant journals (e.g., Journal of the American Statistical Association; Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sprots; American Statistician), books, magazines (e.g., Chance; Significance), and newspapers; + consulting activities with practitioners who face real-world problems; + collaborating with colleagues in statistics, data science, or applied fields; + exploring datasets (public repositories, Kaggle competitions, government/health databases) that reveal new questions; + revisiting your own course work, previous projects, and even class assignments that raised unanswered questions. A critical factor to consider when identifying a topic is data. For statisticians and data scientists, research should often be both problem-driven and data-driven, with methodological development tightly linked to real scientific or societal needs. Problem-driven approach: Start from a real scientific, engineering, business, or societal problem that genuinely matters. The problem motivates the research questions, and data/methods are then sought or developed to address them. This approach ensures relevance and often leads to impactful interdisciplinary collaborations. Data-driven approach: Start from an available dataset and explore it to uncover new questions or methodological challenges. Creativity is needed here to do something novel and meaningful with familiar or widely used data. This kind of research often serves the purpose of hypothesis generation. Idea-driven approach: Begin with a methodological or theoretical idea or problem, and then look for ways to justify or data to test/illustrate. This can lead to elegant theory, but on the other hand, it may also lead to many methods of limited practical relevance. Ultimately, impactful statistical research does not come from problems, ideas, or data alone, but from their dynamic interplay. As Xiao-Li Meng once emphasized, Highly Principled Data Science requires methodologies that are Scientifically justified (rooted in real problems), Statistically principled (built on sound inference), and Computationally efficient (scalable and implementable). Keeping these principles in mind ensures that your project is not only feasible but also both rigorous and relevant. 4.1.2 Initial Planning Once you have identified a promising topic, the next step is to transform a broad idea into a concrete research plan. This involves clarifying your research questions, understanding what data will be needed (or available), and identifying the appropriate methods. Careful planning at this stage will save time later and help avoid common pitfalls. Clarify the research questions Narrow the topic to one or two specific questions. State the research goals in precise terms (e.g., estimating a causal effect, developing a predictive model, establishing a theoretical property, etc.). Frame testable hypotheses. Design the study Decide whether the study will be theoretical, methodological, applied, or a blend. For empirical studies, determine the study design (observational vs. experimental, cross-sectional vs. longitudinal). Consider reproducibility and transparency at the design stage. Make sure to document every steps so that others can follow. Identify and obtain data Decide whether you will collect new data or use existing sources. Evaluate whether available data are sufficient in size, quality, and relevance. Anticipate potential data challenges (missingness, bias, access restrictions). Select appropriate methods Choose statistical or computational tools that match both the problem and the data. Consider multiple candidate approaches. Think about the balance between rigor and feasibility (e.g., a theoretically ideal method vs. one that is conceptually simple and computationally practical). Outline the research and writing plan Draft a tentative structure for the project (introduction, methods, results, discussion). Use the outline to guide both the analyses and the writing. Please note that the goal of initial planning is not to lock yourself into a fixed path; it is impossible as every project is different. This is more about paving a roadmap that helps you stay focused, track progress while leaving room for changes. 4.1.3 Statistical investigation + Perform data analysis. + Summarize substantive findings. + Investigate the performance of proposed methods via simulations. 4.1.4 Iterate between planning and investigation. 4.1.5 Write, revise and proofread. Revising and writing are two separate processes. + Start with an outline for each section which includes major headings, sub-headings and paragraphs covering different points. + When starting, the goal is to get the main points and ideas captured in a document, so at this time, it does not matter if sentences are incomplete or if the grammar is incorrect. + Are the statistical statements correct? + Are the data displays informative? + Are the conclusions based on sound evidence? + Are the style and tone appropriate for the venue? + Is the problem clearly stated? + Check organization — reorganize paragraphs and add transitions where necessary. + Work on sentences — check spelling, punctuation, word choice, tense, etc. + Make sure all researched information is documented (reproducibility). + Rework introduction and conclusion. + Read out loud to check for flow. + Find a friend to review. There are resource online that could be helpful. Here are some examples.

The following components are expected in your proposal. Introduction: Introducing the topic and why you have chosen this topic (3–5 lines). Mention briefly the current related research and cite relevant works. Why shold we care? What have been done? What are new? Specific aims: Formulate a research question or hypothesis in the chosen topic. Describe briefly why you select such a question or hypothesis and its importance in the field (cite sources). Why is it hard/interesting/unstudied? How hard/interesting is it? Data description: Describe your data set (for instance: sampling scheme, number of observations, number of variables, variables of interest, nature of the variables) and the source of your data set if it is not collected by yourself. Research design/methods/schedule: Describe briefly (5-7 lines) your plan of action. Why are the methods appropriate (with proper references) for the problem? What steps are required to use the methods? Which of the steps will be particularly hard? What would you do if the hardest steps do not work as planned? How would the methods help in investigating the task problem? Discussion: potential problems and solutions. What do you expect to find and why do you feel so? Any ways your work can corroborate or challenge existing results or assumptions? What are the potential impacts of your work? What if the results of your investigation is not what you expected? Conclusion (optional): Wrap it up by briefly summarizing your research proposal and reinforcing your research’s stated purpose.
